0. assumptions
    once initiallized, controller is promised to be always running and online.
        (but server can be in any state)
    signals can always be delivered.

1. force a job to end
    client opens a TCP flow with the controller.
    client calls the controller to end a job. message format:
        |pos   |+0      | 
        |------|--------|
        |value |SIG_TERM|
    controller reads 
    controller sends SIGUSR1 to server.
        if fails to send, 
    if a job is running, server terminates the job, otherwise it ignores it.
    server sends SIGUSR1 to controller.
    controller call the client to notify it. message format:
        |pos   |+0      | 
        |------|--------|
        |value |RET_SUCC|
    controller closes the flow.

2. reconfigure the server
    client opens a TCP flow with the controller.
    client calls the controller to reconfigure the server. message format: 
        |pos   |+0      |+1                |+2~+5        |
        |------|--------|------------------|-------------|
        |value |SIG_CONF|TYPE_LONG/TYPE_FIX|int, len/size|
    controller writes the message to shared memory area.
    controller sends SIGUSR2 to server.
    server reads the message from shared memory area.
    server tries to reconfigure itself.
        on success:
            server sends SIGUSR1 to controller.
            controller calls the client to notify it. message format:
                |pos   |+0      | 
                |------|--------|
                |value |RET_SUCC|
        on failure:
            server writes the cause to shared memory area.
            server sends SIGUSR2 to controller.
            controller calls the client to notify it. message format:
                |pos   |+0      |+1~+4   |+5~+(4+len)    |  
                |------|--------|--------|---------------|
                |value |RET_EMSG|int, len|string, message|
    controller closes the flow.

3. start a measurement job
    client opens a TCP flow with the server.
    server sends data as configured (default config is send 1K bytes).
    server closes the flow.
